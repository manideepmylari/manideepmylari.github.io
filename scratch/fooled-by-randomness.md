# Fooled by Randomness

"The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids
us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man's happiness
that may yet,
in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come,
with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has [guaranteed]
continued
happiness until the end we may call happy."'

We can be tricked by situations involving mostly the activities of the Goddess
Fortuna - Jupiter's firstborn daughter.
Solon was wise enough to get the following point; that which came with the help
of luck could be taken away by
luck (and often rapidly and unexpectedly at that).

The flipside, which deserves to be considered as well (in fact it is even more
of our concern),
is that things that come with little help from luck are more resistant to
randomness.
Solon also had the intuition of a problem that has obsessed science for the past
three centuries.
It is called the problem of induction. I call it in this book the **black swan
or the rare event**.

I call the skewness issue; it does not matter how frequently something succeeds
if failure is too costly to bear.

that serotonin, a neurotransmitter, seems to command a large share of our human
behavior.
It sets a positive feedback, the virtuous circle, but, owing to an external kick
from randomness,

investments).
by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e. if history played out
in a different way).
Such substitute courses of events are called alternative histories.

the quality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on its outcome, but such
a point seems to be voiced only by people who fail (those who succeed attribute
their success to the quality of their decision).

Mathematics is not just a "numbers game", it is a way of thinking. We will see
that probability is a qualitative subject.

A mathematician is absorbed in what goes into his head while a scientist
searches into what is outside of himself.

It is difficult to go about life wearing probabilistic glasses, as one starts
seeing fools of randomness all around, in a variety of situations - obdurate

Heroes are heroes because they are heroic in behavior, not because they won or
lost.
Patrocles does not strike us as a hero because of his accomplishments (he was
rapidly killed)
but because he preferred to die than see Achilles sulking into inaction.

Both risk detection and risk avoidance are not medited in the “thinking” part of
the brain but
largely in the emotional one (“the risk as feelings” theory).
The consequences are not trivial: it means that rational thinking has little,
very little, to do with risk avoidance.
Much of what rational thinking seems to do is rationalize one’s actions by
fitting some logic to them.
it is not natural for us to learn from history. We have enough clues to believe
that our
genetic endowment as homo erectus does not favor transfers of experience.

It is a platitude that children learn only from their own mistakes;
they will cease to touch a burning stove only when they are themselves burned;
no possible warning by others can lead to developing the smallest form of
cautiousness.

Adults, too, suffer from such a condition.
This point has been examined by behavioral economics pioneers Daniel Kahneman

the stock market crash of 1987,
those who blew up in the Japan meltdown of 1990,
those who blew up in the bond market debacle of 1994,
those who blew up in Russia in 1998, and
those who blew up buying Nasdaq stocks in 2000

The lucky fool might have benefited from some luck in life;
over the longer run he would slowly converge to the state of a less-lucky idiot.
Those who were unlucky in life in spite of their skills would eventually rise.
Each one would revert to his long-term properties.

by Robert Shiller. Not just in financial markets;
but overall his 1981 paper may be the first mathematically formulated
introspection on the manner society in general handles information.

The principal criticism against Shiller came from Robert C. Merton. that
Merton's hedge fund blew up rather spectacularly

religion and personal behavior,
yet as irrational as possible when it comes to markets and matters ruled by
randomness.

Hume is the first modern epistemologist,

I believe that I cannot have power over myself as I have an ingrained desire to
integrate among people and cultures and would end up resembling them; by
withdrawing
myself entirely I can have a better control of my fate. I am currently enjoying
a thrill of the classics I have not felt since childhood.

we like to emit logical and rational ideas but we do not necessarily enjoy this
execution.
Strange as it sounds, this point has only been discovered very recently
(we will see that we are not genetically fit to be rational and act rationally;
we are 'merely fit for the maximum probability of transmitting our genes in some
given unsophisticated environment).

The philosopher Pascal proclaimed that the optimal strategy for humans is to
believe in the existence of God.
For if God exists, then the believer would be rewarded. If he does not exist,
the
believer would have nothing to lose. Accordingly, we need to accept the
asymmetry in knowledge;
there are situations in which using statistics and econometrics can be useful.
But I do not want my
life to depend on it.

PART II
MONKEYS ON TYPEWRITERS.
SURVIVORSHIP AND OTHER BIASES

How much can past performance (here the typing of the Iliad) be relevant in
forecasting future performance?

it is very unlikely for someone to perform considerably well in a consistent
fashion without his doing something right.
Track records therefore become preeminent.

But, as usual, beware the middlebrow: a small knowledge of probability can lead
to worse results than no knowledge at all.

The greater the number of businessmen, the greater the likelihood of one of them
performing in a stellar manner just by luck.

They are hidden away, as one sees only the winners - it is natural for those who
failed to vanish completely

Accordingly, one sees the survivors, and only the survivors, which imparts such
a mistaken perception of the odds.
We do not respond to probability, but to society's assessment of it.

Part I described situations where people do not understand the rare event, and
do
not seem to accept either the possibility of its occurrence or the dire
consequences of such occurrence.

These biases can be outlined as follows:
(a) the survivorship biases (a.k.a. monkeys on a typewriter), arising from the
fact
that we see only winners and get a distorted view of the odds (Chapters 8 and 9,
Too Many Millionaires and Fry an Egg),
(b) the fact that luck is most frequently the reason for extreme success (
Chapter 10, Loser Takes All), and
(c) the biological handicap of our inability to understand probability (Chapter
11, Randomness and Our Brain).

TOO MANY MIILLIIONAIRES NEXT DOOR

Because he chose to live among the people who have been successful, in an area
that excludes failure.

have repeated that becoming more rational, or not feeling emotions of social
slights is not part of the human race,
at least not with our current DNA code. There is no solace to be found from
reasoning - as a trader
I have learned something about these unfruitful efforts to reason against the
grain.

have no large desire to sacrifice much of my personal habits, intellectual
pleasures,
and personal standards in order to become a billionaire like Warren Buffett,

The first bias comes from the fact that the rich people selected for their
sample are among the lucky monkeys on typewriters.

As to the second, more serious flaw, I have already discussed the problem of
induction.

The mistake of ignoring the survivorship bias is chronic, even (or perhaps
especially) among professionals.
How? Because we are trained to take advantage of the information that is lying
in front of our eyes,
ignoring the information that we do not see.

In a nutshell, the survivorship bias implies that the highest performing
realization will be the most visible.
Why? Because the losers do not show up.

Optimism, it is said, is predictive of success. Predictive? It can also be
predictive of failure.
Optimistic people certainly take more risks as they are overconfident about
odds;
those who win show up among the rich and famous, others fail and disappear from
the analyses. Sadly.
IT IS EASIER TO BUY AND SELL THAN FRY AN EGG

It is preferable to be lucky than competent (but you can be caught).

I will probably lecture him that Machiavelli ascribed to luck at least a 50%
role in life
(the rest was cunning and bravura), and that was before the creation of modern
markets.

Why is finance so rich a field? Because it is one of the rare areas of
investigation
where we have plenty of information (in the form of abundant price series),
but no ability to conduct experiments as in, say, physics. This dependence on
past data brings about its salient defects.

the old popular saying that even a broken clock is right twice a day.

The Monte Carlo generator will toss a coin; heads and the manager will
make $10,000 over the year,
tails and he will lose $10,000. We run it for the first year. At the end of the
year,
we expect 5,000 managers to be up $10,000 each, and 5,000 to be down $10,000.
Now we run the game a second year.
Again, we can expect 2,500 managers to be up two years in a row; another year,
1,250;
a fourth one, 625; a fifth, 313. We have now, simply in a fair game, 313
managers who made money for five years in a row. Out of pure luck.

Remember that nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his failure.

the survivorship bias depends on the size of the initial population.

We need to know the size of the population from which he came. In other words,
without knowing
how many maAagers out there have tried and failed, we will not be able to assess
the validity of the track record.

Philosophers of statistics call this the reference case problem, to explain that
there is no true attainable
randomness in practice, only in theory.

To be honest, I am unable to answer it. I can tell that person A seems less
lucky than person B,
but the confidence in such knowledge can be so weak as to be meaningless.
I prefer to remain a skeptic. People frequently misinterpret my opinion.
I never said that every rich man is an idiot and every unsuccessful person
unlucky,
only that in absence of much additional information I prefer to reserve my
judgment. It is safer.

LOSER TAKES ALL - ON THE
NONLINEARlTlES OF LIFE

The twist: life is unfair in a nonlinear way.

First we define nonlinearity. There are many ways to present it,
but one of the most popular ones in science is what is called the Sandpile
effect,

It could be said that the last grain of sand is responsible for the destruction
of the entire structure. What we are witnessing here is a nonlinear effect
resulting
from a linear force exerted on an object. A very small additional input, here
the grain of sand,
caused a disproportionate result, namely the destruction of my starter tower of
Babel.

"the straw that broke the camel's back"

"the drop that caused the water to spill"

These nonlinear dynamics have a bookstore name; chaos theory, which is a
misnomer
because it has nothing to do with chaos. Chaos theory concerns itself primarily
with functions
in which a small input can lead to a disproportionate response.

Just planned to have a kiss…but got carried away…and hence the baby….
It is an interesting attribute of fame that it has its own dynamics.
An actor becomes known by some parts of the public because he is known by other
parts of the public.

It is obvious that the information age, by homogenizing our tastes, is causing
the unfairness to be even more acute - those who win capture almost all the
customers.
The example that strikes most as the most spectacular lucky success is that of
the software
maker Microsoft and its moody founder Bill Gates. While it is hard to deny that
Gates is a man of high personal standards, work ethics, and above average
intelligence,
is he the best? Does he deserve it? Clearly not. Most people are equipped with
his software
(like myself) because other people are equipped with his software, a purely
circular effect
(economists call that "network externalities"). Nobody ever claimed that it was
the best software product.
Most of Gates's rivals have an obsessive jealousy of his success.
There are maddened by the fact that he managed to win so big while many of them
are struggling to make their companies survive.

Note another advantage of Monte Carlo simulations is that we can get results
where mathematics fails us and can be of no help.

Studies of the dynamics of networks have mushroomed recently. They become
popular with Malcolm Gladwell’s book the tipping point,
in which he shows how some of the behaviors of variables such as epidemics
spread extremely
fast beyond some unspecified critical level (like the use of snickers by
inner-city kids or the diffusion of religious ideas)
Once one exits the conventional model of randomness (the bell curve family of
charted randomness), something acute can happen.
Owing to this non-linearity, people cannot comprehend the nature of rare event.
This summarizes why there are routes to success that are nonrandom, but few,
very few ,
people have the mental stamina to follow them. Those who go the extra mile are
rewarded. Most people give up before rewards.

WAX IN MY EARS -
LIVING WlTH RANDOMITIS

The epiphany I had in my career in randomness came when-I understood that
I was not intelligent enough, nor strong enough, to even try to fight my
emotions.

The difference between myself and those I ridicule is that I try to be aware of
it.

Wittgenstein’s ruler:  unless you have confidence in the rulers reliability,
if you use a ruler to measure a table you may also be using a table to measure
the ruler.
The less you trust the rulers reliability (in probability called prior),
the more information you are getting about the ruler and the less about the
table.
This conditionality of information is central in the epistemology, probability,
even the studies of consciousness.
unless the source of statement has extremely high qualifications,
the statement will be more revealing of the author than the information intended
by him.

The Greek philosopher Pyrrho, who advocated a life of equanimity and

circumstance (he was chased by an ox).
His answer was that he found it sometimes difficult to rid himself of his

CARNEADES COMES TO ROME: ON
PROBABILITY AND SKEPTICISM

probability is not about the odds, but about the belief in the *existence of an
alternative outcome, cause, or motive.

Recall that mathematics is a tool to meditate, not compute.

Carneades was not the first skeptic in classical times, nor was he the first to
teach us the true notion of probability.

but only Popper came to elevate his skepticism to an all-encompassing scientific
methodology).
As the skeptics' main teaching was that nothing could be accepted with
certainty,
conclusions of various degrees of probability could be formed, and these
supplied a guide to conduct.

The Romans did not have a religion per se; they were too tolerant to accept a
given truth.

Indeed, for some strange reason during the middle ages, Arabs were critical
thinkers (through their postclassical philosophical tradition) when Christian
thought was dogmatic,
then after the renaissance, the roles mysteriously reversed.

Self-contradiction is made culturally to be shameful, a matter that can prove
disastrous in science.

We are supposed to be faithful to our opinions. One becomes a traitor otherwise.

There is a simple test to define path dependence of beliefs (economists have a
manifestation of it called the endowment effect).

There are reasons to believe that, for evolutionary purposes, we may be
programmed
to build a loyalty to ideas in which we have invested time

Some medical researchers find that purely rational behavior on the part of
humans
is a sign of a defect in the amygdala, that the subject is, literally, a
psychopath.

An academic who became famous for espousing an opinion is not going to voice
anything
that can possibly devalue his own past work and kill years of investment.

An immediate result of Dr. Markowitz's theory was the near collapse of the
financial
system in the summer of 1998 (as we saw in Chapters 1 and 5) by
Long Term Capital Management ("LTCM"), a Greenwich, Connecticut fund that had
for principals two of
Dr. Markowitz's colleagues, "Nobel" as well. They are Drs. Robert Merton (the
one in Chapter 3 trouncing Shiller) and Myron Scholes.

My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting at my trading boutique by
convincing everyone
that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake prone, but happen
to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it.

Attribution bias: you attribute your success to skills, but your failures to
randomness.
It is a human heuristic that makes us actually believe so in order not to
kill our self-esteem and keep us going against adversity.
The attribution bias has another effect: it gives people the illusion of being
better at what they do,
which explains the finding that 80 to 90% of people think that thay are above
the average (and the median) in many things.

BACCHUS ABANDONS ANTONY

Because the stoic's prescription was precisely to elect what one can do to
control one's destiny in front of a random outcome.

Recall that epic heroes were judged by their actions, not by the results.

No matter how sophisticated our choices, how good we are at dominating the odds,
randomness will have the last word. We are left only with dignity as a
solution - dignity defined as the execution
of a protocol of behavior that does not depend on the immediate circumstance. It
may not be the optimal one,
but it certainly is the one that makes us feel best.

It is worthy of note that before the spread of what can be best called
Mediterranean monotheism,
the ancients did not believe enough in their prayers to influence the course of
destiny.

To many (sophisticated) lovers of poetry, one of the greatest poets who ever
breathed is C.P. Cavafy.
He provides a classical relief for those of us who were subjected to the
middle-class valued
melodrama as represented by Dickens's novels, romantic poetry, and Verdi's
operas.

It is one of the most elevating poems I have ever read, beautiful because it was
the epitome of such dignified aestheticism - and because of the gentle but
edifying
tone of the voice of the narrator advising a man who had just received a
crushing reversal of fortune.

The poem addresses Antony, now defeated and betrayed (according to legend, even
his horse deserted him to go to his enemy Octavius). It asks him to just bid her
farewell, Alexandria the city that is leaving him. It tells him not to mourn his
luck, not to enter denial, not to believe that
his ears and eyes are deceiving him. Antony, do not degrade yourself with empty
hopes. Antony,
Just listen while shaken by emotion but not with the coward's imploration and
complaints.

While shaken with emotion. No stiff upper lip. There is nothing wrong
and undignified with emotions - we are cut to have them. What is wrong is not
following the heroic, or at least, the dignified path. That is what stoicism
truly means.

A more human version can be read in Seneca's Letters From a Stoic, a soothing
and surprisingly readable book that I distribute to my trader friends (Seneca
also took his own life when cornered by destiny).

Good, enlightened (and "friendly") advice and eloquent sermons, do not register
for more than a few moments when they go against our wiring

Try not to play victim when diagnosed with cancer (hide it from others and only
share the information with the doctor - it will avert the platitudes and nobody
will treat you like a victim worthy of their pity; in addition the dignified
attitude will make both defeat and victory feel
equally heroic).

Do not complain. If you suffer from a benign version of the "attitude problem",
like my childhood friend Camille Abousleiman, do not start playing nice guy if
your business dries up (he sent a heroic e-mail to his colleagues informing
them "less business, but same attitude"). The only article Lady Fortuna has no
control over is your behavior. Good luck.
