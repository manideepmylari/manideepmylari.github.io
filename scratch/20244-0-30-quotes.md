It all boils down to the skin in the game. 
Until profits are privatized and failures are democratized,
leaders with think skin won't even give an iota of respect to anything they preach themselves.

If they have equal fear of a backlash for such decision, if the decision taken by 
the leadership and managers are affecting them personally, relying on any ethical
standpoint is like believing Monkeys to cease jumping merely after a lecture on propriety
