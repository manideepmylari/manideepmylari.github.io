- The silver Stripped side is **Cathode**
- Current can only flow from Anode to Cathode
- Zeiner Diode is reverse Biased and allows current to flow only after a certain voltage

Preventing other direction current


# Mono directional control unit - H Bridge
using 4 rectifier diodes

prevents reverse motor run
