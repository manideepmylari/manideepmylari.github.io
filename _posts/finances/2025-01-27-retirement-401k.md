# Employee Deferral and Safe Harbor Match
In a **401(k) plan**, an **Employee Deferral** refers to the portion of your salary that you choose to contribute to your 
retirement account. These contributions are deducted from your paycheck **before taxes**, lowering your taxable income for the year.

### Example:
- **Salary**: $50,000
- **Employee Deferral (5%)**: $2,500  

- This amount is deducted from your paycheck before taxes, meaning you're taxed on **$47,500** instead of the full **$50,000**.

### Contribution Limits for 2025:
- **Under the age of 50**: The standard deferral limit is **$23,000**.
- **50 or Older**: The deferral limit is **$30,500**, which includes a **catch-up contribution**.

### Key Points:
When participating in a 401(k), understanding how your contributions and your employer's contributions work is 
crucial—especially if your plan includes a **Safe Harbor Match**.
