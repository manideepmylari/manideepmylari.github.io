## String Interning

When we use double quotes to create a string, it first looks for the string with the same value in the String Pool. If found it just returns the reference

JVM does so for conserving memory (FLYWAY DESIGN PATTERN).

```java
// Both the String variables are created on the Stack but reference to the same String on heap

String one = "Hello";
String two = "Hello";// JVM uses the String Pool
String three = new String("Hello");// Forcing to create a new String on Heap
String three = "Hello".intern();//intern used
```


```java
//Sting.equals() method checks for string equality while == compares the references

String x = "";
String y = "";
//Here String x and y are two different String objects lying in the "Heap" pointing to the same reference.
if (x == y) {
    System.out.println("x and y are referring to a same String");
}
``` 

Strings are made to be immutable as a consequence from Memory Pool concept.

One string is shared among many objects (due to the String pool concept) due to which string.concat creates a new object everytime. Thus, the use of StringBuilder is preferred to create not string.

StringBuilder is NON-SYNCHRONIZED thus more efficient

StringBuffer is SYNCHRONIZED (THREAD SAFE) means two threads can call the methods of the object simultaneously. Thus comparatively less efficient

```java
String s = new StringBuilder()
                .append("Nitin").append(" Kumar").append(" Chaurasia")
                .toString();
```
### String Methods (Most Important)
{% gist nitinkc/a91ab5df313cbd3e21b6ea71c30f993f %}

String to Char Array to String
```java
String str = "Pneumonia";
char[] c = str.toLowerCase().toCharArray();
Arrays.sort(c);//Returns a null

String revStr = new String(c);
```
