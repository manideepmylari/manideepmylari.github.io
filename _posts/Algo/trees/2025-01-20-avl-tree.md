An AVL tree is a self-balancing **binary search tree** where the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees
(called the balance factor) is **at most 1** for every node.
- Empty Node is -1
- BF = Left Subtree - Right Subtree


### Rotations
- **LL → L goes Left**: A right heavy subtree is balanced by rotating to the left.
- **RR → R goes Right**: A left heavy subtree is balanced by rotating to the right.
- **LR → L first, then R**: Rotate left at the child, then right at the parent.
- **RL → R first, then L**: Rotate right at the child, then left at the parent.


```    
Right Child becomes the left child after LL rotation

Simple LL Rotation
```
Before LL Rotation:              After LL Rotation:

        3                             2
       /                             / \
      2                             1   3
     /
    1
```

Full rotation

Before LL Rotation:              After LL Rotation:

        Root                          X
        /                           /   \
       X                           Y     Root
      / \                         / \    /
     Y   XR                      YL  YR XR
    / \
   YL  YR
