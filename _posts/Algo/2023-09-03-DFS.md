# Depth First Search (DFS)

## Depth-first Search (DFS)

* Memory slightly better than BFS. Bit more memory friendly
* O(V+E)


## With Stack

## Recursion

## Memory Complexity

For a tree like structure, for the purpose of understanding

For a balanced tree with n nodes, there will n/2 leaf nodes due to which the memory complexity of BFS will on O(n)

For DFS, the max memory will the height of the tree which in logN, and that is why the memory complexity is O(logN)
