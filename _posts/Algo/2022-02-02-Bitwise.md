## Bitwise Operations

##### 5 Operators

 1. AND `&`
 2. OR `|`
 3. XOR `^`
 4. NOT `~`
 5. Left Shift `<<` And Right Shift `>>`


## XOR (Cancels each other)

If both are same => FLASE, else True

Thus, if 2 similar things are XOR'd, it will return False. Use this trick to **find Unique numbers** in an Array with O(1) space and O(n) time complexity.'

To find all uniques, use a **set** (On adding in set, if false, remove) as well, but it will use O(n) space and time complexity.

### The XOR Trick

Same variables cancels the effect of each other if the bitwise XOR is used.

```java
// Use of XOR (both flags are boolean) - Exactly one is True
if (flag2 ^ flag4)
//is equivalent to
(flag2 && !flag4) || (!flag2 && flag4);
```

```java
// Works only with integer, in its native form, for others change it into its equivalent binary representation.
a = a^b;
b = a^b; //a^b^b yields a
a = a^b;//a^b^a = b(b is recently converted to a)
```

The logic is used for finding a unique element among duplicates (Stolen Drone problem (21) in Interview cake)
