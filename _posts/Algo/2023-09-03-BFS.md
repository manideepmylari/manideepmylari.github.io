# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

* Visits each node once
* Running time complexity O(V+E)
* Space complexity is not good, due to an extra Queue, which is why DFS is preferred
* Dijkstra's Algo does a BFS if all the edge weight is equal to 1.
* In AI(Machine Learning) Robots can discover surroundings more easily from BFS than DFS
* Important in Maximum Flow - Edmonds-Karp Algorithm
