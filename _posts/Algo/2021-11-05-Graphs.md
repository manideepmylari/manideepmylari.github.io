# Directed Graph

Model a Graph using 
* Adjancy Matrix (2D array of $$ V\times V $$)
* Adjacency List/Set/Map (weighted Graph)

##### Unweighted graph
  * Adjacency List or set of neighbors
  
##### Weighted graph
 * Each entry keeps track of neighbor and weight
 * Easy to implement with maps
 
â€“ Map of Maps (using HashMaps for efficiency)

##### Heap as a Priority Queue in java

# Topological Ordering (Sort)

* In DAG (no cycles in Graph), it is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed (u -> v) edge u comes before v in the ordering
* Yields a valid sequence of the tasks.
* Any directed acyclic graph(DAG) has at least one topological order
* O(V+E) linear running time complexity
* Crucial in Project dependency management and Hamiltonian path(visits each vertex exactly once).
* a Hamiltonian path exits then the topological sort order is unique
* if a topological sort does not form a Hamiltonian path it means the DAG has more valid topological orderings 
* Finding Hamiltonian path is NP-complete problem but we can decide whether such path exists in O(V+E) runing time with topological sort
