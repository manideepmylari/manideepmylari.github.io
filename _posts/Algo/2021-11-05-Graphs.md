# Directed Graph

Model a Graph using 
* Adjancy Matrix (2D array of VXV)
* Adjacency List/Set/Map (weighted Graph)

##### Unweighted graph
  * Adjacency List or set of neighbors
  
##### Weighted graph
 * Each entry keeps track of neighbor and weight
 * Easy to implement with maps
 
â€“ Maps of Maps (using HashMaps for efficiency)

##### Heap as a Priority Queue in java

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

* Visits each node once
* Running time complexity O(V+E)
* Space complexity is not good, due to an extra Queue, which is why DFS is preferred
* Dijkstra's Algo does a BFS if all the edge weight is equal to 1.
