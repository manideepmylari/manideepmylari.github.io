# Directed Graph

Model a Graph using 
* Adjancy Matrix (2D array of VXV)
* Adjacency List/Set/Map (weighted Graph)

##### Unweighted graph
  * Adjacency List or set of neighbors
  
##### Weighted graph
 * Each entry keeps track of neighbor and weight
 * Easy to implement with maps
 
â€“ Map of Maps (using HashMaps for efficiency)

##### Heap as a Priority Queue in java

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

* Visits each node once
* Running time complexity O(V+E)
* Space complexity is not good, due to an extra Queue, which is why DFS is preferred
* Dijkstra's Algo does a BFS if all the edge weight is equal to 1.
* In AI(Machine Learning) Robota can discover surroundings more easilt from BFS than DFS
* Important in Maximum Flow - Edmonds-Karp Algorithm


## Depth-first Search (DFS)

* Memory slightly better than BFS. Bit more memory friendly
 * O(V+E)


 ## Memory Complexity

For a tree like structure, for the purpose of understanding

For a balanced tree with n nodes, there will n/2 leaf nodes due to which the memory complexity of BFS will on O(n)

For DFS, the max memory will the height of the tree which in logN, and that is why the memory complexity is O(logN)

# Topological Ordering (Sort)

* In DAG (no cycles in Graph), it is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed (u -> v) edge u comes before v in the ordering
* Yields a valid sequence of the tasks.
* Any directed acyclic graph(DAG) has at least one topological order
* O(V+E) linear running time complexity
* Crucial in Project dependency management and Hamiltonian path(visits each vertex exactly once).
* a Hamiltonian path exits then the topological sort order is unique
* if a topological sort does not form a Hamiltonian path it means the DAG has more valid topological orderings 
* Finding Hamiltonian path is NP-complete problem but we can decide whether such path exists in O(V+E) runing time with topological sort
