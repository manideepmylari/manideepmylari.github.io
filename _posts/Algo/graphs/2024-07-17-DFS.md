# Depth First Search (DFS)
- Traverse all vertices in a “graph”;
- Traverse **all paths between any two vertices** in a “graph”.

**Time Complexity**: $ O(V+E) $
- 𝑉 represents the number of vertices, and
- 𝐸 represents the number of edges.
- We need to check every vertex and traverse through every edge in the graph.

**Space Complexity**: $ 𝑂(𝑉^2) $
- created stack or the recursive call stack can store up to V⋅V vertices
- worst case - each vertex has edges connecting to all other vertices.


- Traversing all Vertices
- Traversing all paths between two vertices

# BFS
- Traversing all vertices in the “graph”;
- Finding **the shortest path** between two vertices in a graph where all edges have
  equal and positive weights.


* Visits each node once
* Running time complexity O(V+E)
* Space complexity is not good, due to an extra Queue, which is why DFS is
  preferred
* Dijkstra's Algo does a BFS if all the edge weight is equal to 1.
* In AI(Machine Learning) Robots can discover surroundings more easily from BFS
  than DFS
* Important in Maximum Flow - Edmonds-Karp Algorithm
