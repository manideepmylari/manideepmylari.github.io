# Depth First Search (DFS)
- Traverse all vertices in a “graph”;
- Traverse **all paths between any two vertices** in a “graph”.

**Time Complexity**: $ O(V+E) $
- 𝑉 represents the number of vertices, and
- 𝐸 represents the number of edges.
- We need to check every vertex and traverse through every edge in the graph.

**Space Complexity**: $ 𝑂(𝑉^2) $
- created stack or the recursive call stack can store up to V⋅V vertices
- worst case - each vertex has edges connecting to all other vertices.


- Traversing all Vertices
- Traversing all paths between two vertices

# Create Graph from List of Edges
if `edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]]` are given, first create a graph before applying DFS or BFS

If graph consists of integer nodes beginning 0 or 1

# Recursive backtracking

Base case for recursion
```java
//Base cases
if(//Covering the 4 corners
    r < 0 || c < 0 //Math.min(r,c) < 0 //Left & Upper bound
    || r == grid.length //right bound
    || c == grid[0].length //lower bound
    // Blockers as per the problem
    || grid[r][c] == 1 //Blocked
    //Visited check
    || visited.contains(r+""+c) //Already Visited
  ){
    return ...;//Depends if count is needed or a void is returned
}
```

Terminating conditions, if there is one fixed condition.
- [1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph/)
```java
//Terminating condition, when the rightmost Bottom corner is reached
if(r == grid.length-1 && c == grid[0].length-1){
    return 1;
}
```

If all possibilities are to be searched
- [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/)
- [River Sizes](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/river-sizes)
```java
int count = 0;
HashSet<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
for(int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++){
  for(int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++){
    if(grid[i][j] == '1' && !visited.contains(i+""+j)){
        count++;
        gridDFS(grid,i,j,visited);
    }
  }
}
```

The directions array comes handy with BFS as there are no recursive calls
```java
private static final int[][] directions = {
        {1, 0}, //Next Row → , Keeping Column constant
        {-1, 0}, //Previous Row ←
        {0, 1}, //Column above ↑, Keeping Row constant
        {0, -1}}; //Column above ↓

//while performing dfs
for (int[] dir : directions) {
    dfs(grid, r + dir[0], c + dir[1]);
}
```

##### Using Recursion
Pass the updated `visited` array so that the other calls have the updated set
- A `HashSet<Node> visited` can be used used to keep track of visited node
  - use `visited.add(r+""+c)` 
  - use `visited.contains(r+""+c)`
- 
```java
//Recursive Backtracking
gridDFS(grid,r,c+1,visited);
gridDFS(grid,r,c-1,visited);
gridDFS(grid,r+1,c,visited);
gridDFS(grid,r-1,c,visited);
```


# BFS
- Traversing all vertices in the “graph”;
- Finding **the shortest path** between two vertices in a graph where all edges have
  equal and positive weights.


* Visits each node once
* Running time complexity O(V+E)
* Space complexity is not good, due to an extra Queue, which is why DFS is
  preferred
* Dijkstra's Algo does a BFS if all the edge weight is equal to 1.
* In AI(Machine Learning) Robots can discover surroundings more easily from BFS
  than DFS
* Important in Maximum Flow - Edmonds-Karp Algorithm
