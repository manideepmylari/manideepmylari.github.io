- all the hooks are present by default with `.sample` file extension in `.git/hooks`
- remove the file extension
- execute this command to make it executable
```shell
chmod +x pre-commit
```

# pre commit

Prevent commits to special branches

PROTECTED_BRANCHES="^(master|develop|release-*|bugfix-*)"

```shell
if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" =~ ($SPECIAL_BRANCH) ]]; then
  echo >&2 "Preventing commit on $CURRENT_BRANCH branch"
  echo >&2 "commit with -n switch to bypass the pre-commit hook."
  echo >&2 "Hooks at Repo would prevent push directly to such branch"
  exit 1
```
to bypass the hook

```shell
 git commit -n -m "final commit"
```
