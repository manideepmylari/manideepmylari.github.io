- all the hooks are present by default with `.sample` file extension in `.git/hooks`
- remove the file extension
- execute this command to make it executable
```shell
touch pre-commit
chmod +x pre-commit
```

# pre commit

Prevent commits to special branches

PROTECTED_BRANCHES="^(master|develop|release-*|bugfix-*)"

```shell
if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" =~ ($SPECIAL_BRANCH) ]]; then
  echo >&2 "Preventing commit on $CURRENT_BRANCH branch"
  echo >&2 "commit with -n switch to bypass the pre-commit hook."
  echo >&2 "Hooks at Repo would prevent push directly to such branch"
  exit 1
```
to bypass the hook

```shell
 git commit -n -m "final commit"
```

Allow creation of a new branch if attempted to commit to a restricted branch
```shell
# Get the current branch name
current_branch=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)
# List of branches where commits are restricted
restricted_branches=("main" "develop" "bugfix")

# Check if the current branch is restricted
if [[ " ${restricted_branches[@]} " =~ " ${current_branch} " ]]; then
    echo "Error: Commits to branch '${current_branch}' are not allowed."
    echo "Using git switch -c new-branch-name to switch to a new branch"
    
    # Generate a unique branch name with current date and timestamp
    new_branch_name="feature/new_branch_$(date +'%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')"
    echo " switching to the new branch $new_branch_name" 
    git switch -c $new_branch_name
    
    exit 1
fi
```
