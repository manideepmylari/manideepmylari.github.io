# Overview

* Computing resources can be allocated as individual VMs or clusters of VMs that you manage. 

* Managed kubernetes cluster (GKE) can also be used and it relieves of some of the operational overhead of managing a kubernetes cluster. 

* Serverless computing options relieve users of any server management. 

* Managed services and serverless options are good choices when you do not need control over the computing environment and will get more value from not having to manage compute resources.

###  Different forms of cloud storage 

* Four main categories of storage: *object, file, block, and in-memory caches*. 

* Highly reliable and durable storage of objects, such as images or data sets. 
    * limited functionality than file system–based storage systems. 

* File system–based storage : hierarchical directory storage for files and supports common operating system and file system functions. 

File system services provide network-accessible file systems that can be accessed by multiple servers. B

* Block storage is used for storing data on disks. File systems and databases make use of block storage systems. Block storage is used with persistent storage devices, such as SSDs and HDDs. Caches are in-memory data stores used to minimize the latency of retrieving data. They do not provide persistent storage and should never be considered a “system of truth.”
