1. **Maximize Spring Mix Usage**: Use it as the primary base, mixing in small amounts of lettuce for variety.
2. **Balance Nutrition**: Incorporate proteins (eggs, beans), healthy fats (avocado, nuts), and carbs (quinoa, sweet potato).
3. **Batch Prep Sprouts**: Prepare sprouted moong and chana ahead of time to save effort.
4. **Rotate Add-Ons**: Add fresh or roasted veggies, seeds, or nuts for new textures and flavors.
