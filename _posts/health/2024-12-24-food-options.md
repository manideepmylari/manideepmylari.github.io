# 1. Seeds
**Definition**: A seed is the embryonic plant enclosed in a protective covering.
It contains all the nutrients required for a plant to grow.

- **Examples**:
    - **Edible Seeds**:
        - Quinoa (pseudocereal)
        - Chia seeds
        - Flaxseeds
        - Sunflower seeds
        - Pumpkin seeds
        - Sesame seeds (til)
        - Basil seeds (sabja)
        - Hemp seeds
        - Watermelon seeds
        - Mustard seeds (used as spice)
- **Nutritional Profile**:
    - High in healthy fats, protein, fiber, and vitamins.
    - Gluten-free.

# 2. Grains
**Definition**: Grains are the edible seeds of certain grasses (family Poaceae), 
part of the grass plant's reproductive system.

- **Structure**:
    - **Bran**: Outer protective layer, rich in fiber and nutrients.
    - **Endosperm**: Middle part, mainly starch and energy.
    - **Germ**: Core, rich in vitamins and fats.
- **Global Grains**:
    - Wheat
    - Rice (brown, white, wild)
    - Corn (maize)
    - Barley
    - Oats
    - Rye
    - Sorghum (*jowar*)
    - Broken wheat (*dalia*)
    - Maize (*makka*)
    - Red rice (*matta rice*)
- **Nutritional Profile**:
    - Provides carbohydrates, some protein, and varying amounts of fiber.
    - Whole grains (e.g., brown rice) are more nutritious than refined grains (e.g., white rice).

# 3. Millets
**Definition**: Millets are small-seeded grains that belong to a group of grass species. 
They are a category of grains known for their hardiness.

- **Major Millets**:
    - Pearl millet (*bajra*)
    - Finger millet (*ragi*)
    - Sorghum (*jowar*)
- **Minor Millets**:
    - Foxtail millet (*kangni*)
    - Little millet (*kutki*)
    - Barnyard millet (*jhangora*)
    - Kodo millet (*kodra*)
    - Proso millet (*cheena*)
- **Other Indian Millets**:
    - Browntop millet
    - Amaranth (*rajgira*) (technically a pseudocereal, often included in millet-like discussions)
- **Nutritional Profile**:
    - High in fiber, protein, and micronutrients like magnesium, iron, and calcium.
    - Gluten-free and low glycemic index, ideal for managing blood sugar.

# 4. Legumes and Dals (Split Pulses)
**Definition**: Legumes are plants in the *Fabaceae* family that produce seeds in pods. 
Dals are the split, dried seeds of legumes. While all dals are legumes, not all 
legumes are considered dals.

- **Examples of Legumes**:
    - Beans: Kidney beans, black beans, soybeans.
    - Peas: Green peas, split peas, chickpeas.
    - Lentils: Red lentils, green lentils.
    - Peanuts.
- **Examples of Dals (Indian Split Pulses)**:
    - **Toor Dal (Pigeon Peas)**: Mild flavor, used in sambar.
    - **Moong Dal (Green Gram)**: Easily digestible.
    - **Masoor Dal (Red Lentils)**: Quick-cooking, sweet flavor.
    - **Chana Dal (Split Chickpeas)**: Nutty taste.
    - **Urad Dal (Black Gram)**: Used in idli, dosa batter.
- **Nutritional Profile**:
    - Legumes and dals are high in protein and dietary fiber.
    - Contain complex carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.
    - Dals are easier to digest and cook faster than whole legumes.
    - Rich in iron, folate, and fiber.
    - Low glycemic index, making them ideal for balanced diets.
