##### For each method **applies the lambda** to each element of the collection

```java
//Prints each element
list.stream().forEach(str -> System.out.println(str));

//Where ever Lambda is there it can be replaced by method reference
list.stream().forEach(System.out :: print);
```

## Double Colon Operator

| S.no| Kind                                                  | Example                              |
|---- |-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------+
| 1  | Reference to a static method                          | ContainingClass::staticMethodName  |
| 2  |Reference to an instance method of a particular object | containingObject::instanceMethodName |
| 3  | Reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type | ContainingType::methodName           |
| 4  |Reference to a constructor                             | ClassName::new                       |

## Predefined Functional Interface

Defined in java.util.function

1. Predicate (test(), returns boolean) - Used with filter() in Stream API
2. Function (apply(T k), return user defined TYPE) - Used with map() in Stream API
3. Consumer (accept()), - Used with forEach() method
4. Supplier (get()),

### Predicate (used with Filters)

java.util.function.Predicate, represents a simple function that takes a single value as parameter, and returns true or false.

```java
public interface Predicate<T> {
    boolean test(T t);
}

**Predicate uses a Lambda that returns true and false**

Predicate<Student> firstNameLength = Student -> (Student.getfName().length() <= 3);
Predicate<Student> semPredicate = Student -> (Student.getSem() == 1);
Predicate<Student> deptPredicate = Student -> (Student.getDeptCode().equalsIgnoreCase("mec"));

//Find out all the students based on firstNameLength predicate
System.out.println("Find out all the students based on firstNameLength predicate");
studentList
  .stream()
  .filter(firstNameLength)
  .forEach(System.out::println);

//Find all students from 1st Sem
System.out.println("Find all students from 1st Sem");
studentList
  .stream()
  .filter(semPredicate)
  .forEach(System.out::println);

//Composite Predicate : All Students from CSE of First sem
System.out.println("Composite Predicate : All Students from CSE of First sem");
studentList
  .stream()
  .filter(semPredicate.and(deptPredicate.negate()))
  .forEach(System.out::println);

//Same as above
studentList
  .stream()
  .filter(semPredicate)
  .filter(deptPredicate.negate())
  .forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Function (used with MAP)

The Function interface represents a function (method) that takes a single parameter and returns a single value. Here is how the Function interface definition looks:

```java
public interface Function<T, R> {
    R apply(T t);
}

**Write Lambda in such a way that it accepts an argument and performs an action on it**

function is used in map() function

List<String> list = Arrays.asList("1","2","3", "n", "",null);
final int DEFAULT_VALUE = 9999;

// Function to convert Strings to Int, put 9999 as default value for other cases
Function<String, Integer> function = x -> NumberUtils.toInt(x,DEFAULT_VALUE);
// Predicate to replace to test if the number in the list is a Default value.
Predicate<Integer> predicate = (Integer x) -> (x == DEFAULT_VALUE);

//Print entire list
list
    .stream()
    .map(function)
    .forEach(System.out::println);

//all the numbers except for the default replacement number
list.stream()
    .map(function)
    .filter(predicate.negate())
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```

### BiFunction
```java
public interface BiFunction<T, U, R> {
     R apply(T t, U u);
     ...
}
```
higher-order functions. Two common examples are filter and map.

A filter processes a list in some order to produce a new list containing exactly those elements of the original list for which a given predicate (think Boolean expression) returns true.
A map applies a given function to each element of a list, returning a list of results in the same order.

Another common higher-order function is reduce, which is more commonly known as a fold. This function reduces a list to a single value.

##### Sorting a set

### Consumer : (used with forEach) takes generified argument and returns nothing

It is a function that is representing side effects
```java
public interface Consumer<T> {
    void accept(T t);
}

List<String> strList = Arrays.asList("test","this","is","a","test","this","test","is","not","complex");

Consumer<String> c = s -> System.out.print(s + " ,");
//Consumer<String> c = System.out::println;
strList.stream().forEach(c);
```

{% gist nitinkc/ff63f3c1d164ef3b8dfe3a91a02e3259 %}

### Supplier
```java
public interface Supplier<T> {
    T get();
}


//Static method Reference
Supplier<LocalDate> s1 = LocalDate::now;
//Lambda Expression
Supplier<LocalDate> s2 = () -> LocalDate.now();

```

# Java Streams

(Java Streams API Java doc)[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html]
* A stream in Java is a sequence of data that takes input from Collections or IO Channels
* Streams donâ€™t change the original data structure.
* A Stream Pileline is the operation (STREAM OPERATIONS) that run on a stream to produce a result
* Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result.
* Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.
* Finite Streams have a limit
* infinite Streams are like sunrise/sunset cycle

* **SOURCE** : Where the stream comes from
* **INTERMEDIATE OPERATIONS** : Transforms the stream into another stream. STREAMS USE LAZY EVALUATION.
* **The intermediate operations do not run until the terminal operation runs.**
* **TERMINAL OPERATION**: Actually produces a result. Stream becomes invalid after terminal operation


## Intermediate Operations:

* **map**: The map method is used to returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream.

* **filter**: The filter method is used to select elements as per the Predicate passed as argument.

* **sorted**: The sorted method is used to sort the stream.

## Terminal Operations:

* **collect**: The collect method is used to return the result of the intermediate operations performed on the stream.

* **forEach**: The forEach method is used to iterate through every element of the stream.

* **reduce**: The reduce method is used to reduce the elements of a stream to a single value.
The reduce method takes a BinaryOperator as a parameter.

# Optional

* New class Optional in java.util package.
* It is a Container to hold at most one value, like Collections and Arrays.
* To represent a value if its present or absent.
* Avoids any runtime NullPointerExceptions

In Streams API, Optional is returned


### Non-Terminal Operations
filter()
map()
flatMap()
distinct()
limit()
peek()

### Terminal Operations
anyMatch()
allMatch()
noneMatch()
collect()
count()
findAny()
findFirst() - returns Optional
forEach()
min()
max()
reduce()
toArray()
