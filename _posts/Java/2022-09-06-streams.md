# Java Streams

* A stream in Java is a sequence of data that takes input from Collections or IO Channels
* Streams **don’t change** the original data structure.
* A Stream Pileline is the operation (STREAM OPERATIONS) that run on a stream to produce a result
* Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result.
* Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.
* Finite Streams have a limit
* infinite Streams are like sunrise/sunset cycle

re-stream a List each time. Dont Re-use a stream because “creating” a Stream just points at the existing data structure behind the scenes; it does not copy the data.

Streams 

 * Do not support indexed access
      * finFirst() can give top of the element, but not the second or third or last element
 * Simple syntax to build a List or array from a Stream


 # Three  common ways to make a Stream
  * list.stream() -- From ArrayList
  * Stream.of(arrayOfObjects) [not array of primitives!]
    ```java
    Student[] students = {....};
    Stream<Student> studentStream = Stream.of(students).map(…).filter(…).other(…);//No Terminal Operator
    ```
  * Stream.of(val1, val2, ...) -- Individual elements 
    ```java
    Student s1 = …;
    Student s2 = …;
    
    Stream<Student> studentStream = Stream.of(s1,s2, ...).map(…).filter(…).other(…);;//No Terminal Operator
    ```

## Outputting Streams

Getting a List out of a Stream
  ```java
    List<SomeClass> list = someStream.map(…).collect(Collectors.toList());
  ```

Getting an Array out of a Stream
```java
  //Fill elements into an Array from a Stream
  Student[] studentArray = someStream.map(someLambda).toArray(Student[]::new);
  String[] strArray = stringStream.filter(...).map(...).toArray(String[]::new);
```


```
Student[] studentArray = studentStream.toArray()
```
# What **Cannot** be done with Streams forEach

1. Multiple Loops are not possible as for each is a Terminal operation consuming a Stream.
2. Local variable modification
    `list.stream().forEach(e -> total += e);`
      * do this with “map” and “reduce”.
      * Or use builtin “sum” method of DoubleStream or Int Stream
3. Cannot use break or return within forEach loop  

It uses a stateful lambda expression.


## Stream Operations

* **SOURCE** : Where the stream comes from
* **INTERMEDIATE OPERATIONS** : Transforms the stream into another stream. STREAMS USE LAZY EVALUATION.
  * **map**: The map method is used to returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream.
  * **filter**: The filter method is used to select elements as per the Predicate passed as argument.
  * **sorted**: The sorted method is used to sort the stream.
* **The intermediate operations do not run until the terminal operation runs.**
* **TERMINAL OPERATION**: Actually produces a result. Stream becomes invalid after terminal operation
  * **collect**: The collect method is used to return the result of the intermediate operations performed on the stream.
  * **forEach**: The forEach method is used to iterate through every element of the stream.
  * **reduce**: The reduce method is used to reduce the elements of a stream to a single value. The reduce method takes a BinaryOperator as a parameter.

### Non-Terminal Operations
filter()
map()
flatMap()
distinct()
limit()
peek()

### Terminal Operations
anyMatch()
allMatch()
noneMatch()
collect()
count()
findAny()
findFirst() - returns Optional
forEach()
min()
max()
reduce()
toArray()
