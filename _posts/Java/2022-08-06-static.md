Mainly for memory management

blocks, variables, methods & nested class (inner class)

Static belong to class NOT to the instance (object)

Static Variable : gets memory only once in the class area at the TIME OF LOADING

Static Methods : Invoked without creating instance (Math.pow())

can access static data member

Inheritance only parent visible

Static methods Restrictions

* Cannot use non static data field or method directly
* Cannot use this and super on the static context

Static Initialization Blocks

Runs First, at class loading.

Can have as many blocks as possible 


there are some common or recurring patterns that show up in lambda expressions.

- In one case, a lambda expression will often take some arguments and invoke a static method on a class passing exactly
  the arguments to the lambda expression, directly to the method arguments of that static method.

- Another case takes the lambda arguments and passes them completely intact to a method that is invoked on an object.

- A third case gain takes the lambdas arguments and passes them to a constructor.

- And another format will take the first argument from the lambda, and use that to invoke a method. The remaining
  arguments from the lambda are then passed as the method arguments to that invocation.

> (a, ...) -> a.method(...) gets changed to
> MyClass::method

```java
.map(w ->  vcw.toLowerCase())

.map(String :: toLowerCase())
```

And it turns out that when we have any one of these four forms but notice it must be exactly these four forms we don't
get to reorder the arguments or anything like that

private static final Pattern WORD_BREAK = Pattern.compile("\\W+");

//Word break is an object .flatMap( l -> WORD_BREAK.splitAsStream(l))
.flatMap(WORD_BREAK::splitAsStream)
