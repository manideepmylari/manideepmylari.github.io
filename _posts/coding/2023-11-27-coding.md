**The Log Formula**

$$ \log_{base}{index} = {power} $$

For Example : $$ \log_{10}{100} = 2 $$

**The Exponent formula**

$$ base^{power} = index $$

For Example :  $$ 10^{3} = 1000 $$

# Counting the number of digits

$$
\text{number of digits, n} = \lfloor \log_{10}(x) \rfloor + 1 \text{, where x is an integer number}
$$

```java
int i = 123456789;
int numOfDigits = (int) Math.floor(Math.log10(i)) + 1;
```

Extracts Least Significant Bit

Since the binary representation of 1 is 000...01 (with all other bits being zero), this operation effectively extracts the least significant bit of x. If the least significant bit of x is 1, the result is 1; otherwise, it's 0.

```java
x & 1
```

XOR 

The XOR operation returns `1` for bits that are different and `0` for bits that are the same.

The expression x & (x - 1) is a bitwise operation commonly used to unset the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of the integer x. Here's how it works:

Subtracting 1 from x flips the rightmost set bit and sets all the bits to its right to 1.
Performing the bitwise AND operation with x and x - 1 results in all bits being preserved except for the rightmost set bit, which becomes 0.
In other words, this operation effectively removes the rightmost (lowest-order) 1-bit in the binary representation of x.
