Webhooks operate under the principle of "event-driven" communication: 
the server sends data to the client when an event occurs,
without the client needing to poll for updates. 


Essentially, a webhook is an HTTP callback triggered by an event. 
It involves setting up an endpoint in your Spring Boot application that can 
accept and process incoming HTTP requests (usually POST).
