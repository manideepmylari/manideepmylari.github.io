The size of the thread pool that is used in Spring Boot
- by default, Tomcat uses a threadpool size of 200. 
- It means that If 250 concurrent users hit spring boot application, 50 of them are going to wait for a platform thread to process their request

```yaml
spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true
```
