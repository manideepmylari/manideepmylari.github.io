# EMI Formula

$$
EMI = \frac{P \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
$$

## EMI Calculation for Interest Rate: 7.5

for a principal amount of $500,000 Loan Over 30 Years

$$
r = \frac{7.5}{100 \times 12} = 0.00625
$$

$$ EMI = \frac{500000 \times 0.00625 \times (1 + 0.00625)^{360}}{(1 + 0.00625)^{360} - 1} $$

$ EMI \approx 3,507.24 $
