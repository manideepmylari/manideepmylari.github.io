Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking
Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking is a decentralized network architecture where each participant (peer) can act as both a client and a server. Here are the key points:

# Key Characteristics
**Decentralization**: There is no central server. Each peer is equally privileged and can initiate or complete any task.

**Scalability**: P2P networks can easily scale as more peers join the network.

**Fault Tolerance**: Since there is no single point of failure, the network is more resilient. If one peer fails, others can continue to operate.

# How P2P Works
Discovery: Peers find each other through various methods, such as a central directory or using distributed hash tables (DHTs).

Handshake: Peers establish a connection by exchanging information about the protocols and data formats they support.

Data Exchange: Peers can directly share files or data with each other.

# Protocols
BitTorrent: Used for efficient file sharing. Files are broken into small pieces, and peers download pieces from each other.

Gnutella: A decentralized file-sharing protocol where peers query each other to find files.

Kademlia (DHT): A protocol for storing and retrieving key-value pairs in a decentralized manner.

Bitcoin/Ethereum (Blockchain): Cryptocurrencies use P2P networks to maintain a distributed ledger of transactions.

# Use Cases
File Sharing: Sharing large files (e.g., movies, software). Examples: BitTorrent.

Content Distribution: Distributing content efficiently by leveraging multiple peers. Examples: Some streaming services.

Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum use P2P networks for secure and decentralized transaction processing.

VoIP: Voice and video calls over P2P networks. Examples: Skype.

Decentralized Applications (dApps): Applications that run on blockchain networks, providing greater security and resilience.
