# Skip List


# Hash index: 
a very common implementation of the “Map” data structure (or “Collection”)

# SSTable - Sorted String Tables

# LSM tree: Skiplist + SSTable


# B-tree: 
disk-based solution. Consistent read/write performance


# Inverted index:
used for document indexing. Used in Lucene

# Suffix tree: 
for string pattern search

# R-tree: 
multi-dimension search, such as finding the nearest neighbor
