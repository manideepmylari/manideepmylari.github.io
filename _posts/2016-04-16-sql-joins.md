JOINS
    INNER & OUTER
    INNER – EQUI JOIN, NON-EQUI JOIN, NATURAL JOIN, SELF JOIN
    OUTER – LEFT, RIGHT & FULL

OUTER is result of INNER & some additional data   
Data from one of the tables or from both the tables

INNER – select t1.* from t1, t2 where t1.c = t2.c
And t2.d > 2000
SELF JOIN – only one table is involved in join
Select t1.* from KYC k1, KYC k2 where k1.kyc_ind = K2.kyc_ind

OUTER is smarter than INNER
Customer – cust_id -1,2,3
Sales – cust_id- 3, 6

Select * from customer c, sales s where c.cust_id = s.cust_id

Select * from customer c LEFT OUTER JOIN sales s ON c.cust_id = s.sales_id
Select * from customer c RIGHT OUTER JOIN sales s ON c.cust_id = s.sales_id
Select * from customer c FULL OUTER JOIN sales s ON c.cust_id = s.sales_id
